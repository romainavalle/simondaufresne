> WARNING : I have done this site for a friend on my spare time late at night after a full day of work and taking care of my 2 kids...  
I have code several versions of it!  
So, this is not supposed to be the best code ever, a lot of mistakes are in it and you'll find a lot of dirty coded components. Am sure that there is thousand of better ways to do it.  
The only reason am sharing this code is to help people to find their way into front-end development.
